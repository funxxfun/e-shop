semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm
===========================================

## Install

```bash
npm install semver
````

## Usage

As a node module:

```js
const semver = require('semver')

semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'
semver.valid('a.b.c') // null
semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'
semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true
semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false
semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true
semver.minVersion('>=1.0.0') // '1.0.0'
semver.valid(semver.coerce('v2')) // '2.0.0'
semver.valid(semver.coerce('42.6.7.9.3-alpha')) // '42.6.7'
```

You can also just load the module for the function that you care about, if
you'd like to minimize your footprint.

```js
// load the whole API at once in a single object
const semver = require('semver')

// or just load the bits you need
// all of them listed here, just pick and choose what you want

// classes
const SemVer = require('semver/classes/semver')
const Comparator = require('semver/classes/comparator')
const Range = require('semver/classes/range')

// functions for working with versions
const semverParse = require('semver/functions/parse')
const semverValid = require('semver/functions/valid')
const semverClean = require('semver/functions/clean')
const semverInc = require('semver/functions/inc')
const semverDiff = require('semver/functions/diff')
const semverMajor = require('semver/functions/major')
const semverMinor = require('semver/functions/minor')
const semverPatch = require('semver/functions/patch')
const semverPrerelease = require('semver/functions/prerelease')
const semverCompare = require('semver/functions/compare')
const semverRcompare = require('semver/functions/rcompare')
const semverCompareLoose = require('semver/functions/compare-loose')
const semverCompareBuild = require('semver/functions/compare-build')
const semverSort = require('semver/functions/sort')
const semverRsort = require('semver/functions/rsort')

// low-level comparators between versions
const semverGt = require('semver/functions/gt')
const semverLt = require('semver/functions/lt')
const semverEq = require('semver/functions/eq')
const semverNeq = require('semver/functions/neq')
const semverGte = require('semver/functions/gte')
const semverLte = require('semver/functions/lte')
const semverCmp = require('semver/functions/cmp')
const semverCoerce = require('semver/functions/coerce')

// working with ranges
const semverSatisfies = require('semver/functions/satisfies')
const semverMaxSatisfying = require('semver/ranges/max-satisfying')
const semverMinSatisfying = require('semver/ranges/min-satisfying')
const semverToComparators = require('semver/ranges/to-comparators')
const semverMinVersion = require('semver/ranges/min-version')
const semverValidRange = require('semver/ranges/valid')
const semverOutside = require('semver/ranges/outside')
const semverGtr = require('semver/ranges/gtr')
const semverLtr = require('semver/ranges/ltr')
const semverIntersects = require('semver/ranges/intersects')
const simplifyRange = require('semver/ranges/simplify')
const rangeSubset = require('semver/ranges/subset')
```

As a command-line utility:

```
$ semver -h

A JavaScript implementation of the https://semver.org/ specification
Copyright Isaac Z. Schlueter

Usage: semver [options] <version> [<version> [...]]
Prints valid versions sorted by SemVer precedence

Options:
-r --range <range>
        Print versions that match the specified range.

-i --increment [<level>]
        Increment a version by the specified level.  Level can
        be one of: major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor,
        prepatch, or prerelease.  Default level is 'patch'.
        Only one version may be specified.

--preid <identifier>
        Identifier to be used to prefix premajor, preminor,
        prepatch or prerelease version increments.

-l --loose
        Interpret versions and ranges loosely

-p --include-prerelease
        Always include prerelease versions in range matching

-c --coerce
        Coerce a string into SemVer if possible
        (does not imply --loose)

--rtl
        Coerce version strings right to left

--ltr
        Coerce version strings left to right (default)

Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies
all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.

If no satisfying versions are found, then exits failure.

Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying
multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.
```

## Versions

A "version" is described by the `v2.0.0` specification found at
<https://semver.org/>.

A leading `"="` or `"v"` character is stripped off and ignored.

## Ranges

A `version range` is a set of `comparators` which specify versions
that satisfy the range.

A `comparator` is composed of an `operator` and a `version`.  The set
of primitive `operators` is:

* `<` Less than
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>` Greater than
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,
  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.

For example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`
or `1.1.0`.

Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,
which is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators
it includes.

A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A
version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.

For example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,
or `1.1.0`.

The range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,
`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.

### Prerelease Tags

If a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then
it will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one
comparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a
prerelease tag.

For example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the
version `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by
`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater
than" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version
range only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The
version `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a
prerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.

The purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions
frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes
that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption.
Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching
semantics.

Second, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has
clearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of
alpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,
the user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it
is still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a
similar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.

Note that this behavior can be suppressed (treating all prerelease
versions as if they were normal versions, for the purpose of range
matching) by setting the `includePrerelease` flag on the options
object to any
[functions](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#functions) that do
range matching.

#### Prerelease Identifiers

The method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that
will append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:

```javascript
semver.inc('1.2.3', 'prerelease', 'beta')
// '1.2.4-beta.0'
```

command-line example:

```bash
$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta
1.2.4-beta.0
```

Which then can be used to increment further:

```bash
$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease
1.2.4-beta.1
```

### Advanced Range Syntax

Advanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in
deterministic ways.

Advanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive
comparators using white space or `||`.
